  <h>WHY I CHOOSE BIS</h>
  <p>I have chosen BIS for many reason , but one of the prominant reason in why i have decided to go down this
  route began in fourth year, When a speaker came to our school to inform us of what the course intails.
  It seemed to fit my abilities perfectly as i always had a natural ability for problem solving along with
  an interest in technoly and the way it changes the runnings of businesses. Another aspect to the degree is the 
  variability to the jobs available to me and the money being earned.</p>
