        	in and out of the city of Rome as we please. My favourite activities 
        	to do their are shopping and site seeing.</p>

        	<p>This summer myself and two of my friends have decided to go interailing. As you may, 
        	or may not know interailing is a ofrm our traveling through Europe with only a backpack.
        	We have decided to go interailing as we have all loved the idea of traveling the but find 
        	often it can come at a great expense. Interailing allows you to see many diffent countries,
        	while experience many different cultures at half the price
