    <h2>Why do I love cloud computing?</h2>
    <p1>Cloud services maybe newer on the market but are defiantly going to be here
    for the long haul. I enjoy using these services for many reason which I will 
    discuss down below. It is said that30% growth for the Cloud industry,  it will
    be hitting $270 billion by the year 2020. More and more people adopt the latest
    technology to store, share, and most importantly, use data in a virtual space.</p1>
    
    <h1><strong>Essential Characteristics of Cloud Computing:</strong></h1>

  <p>In my personal experince, features like this is why people appreciate cloud as much as I do. </p>
  
  <p>On-demand self-service</p>
  <p>Broad network access</p>
  <p>Resource pooling</p>
  <p>Rapid elasticity</p>
  <p>easured service</p>

<h1>If you’re still one of the naysayers in moving to cloud maybe you should take
a look at the following big companies who are on board with cloud:</h1>
	<p>Netflix. Yes, your favorite Netflix. Since it decided to split, the company
	made a comeback and is now responsible for the US’s internet traffic every night.
	Now, imagine if Netflix had to host its own server to ge this job done.
	Pinterest. Pinterest is your all-time favorite pinboard that took the Internet
	by storm a few years ago. The company has relied on the cloud from the start.
	This has allowed Pinterest to accept large amount of data while maintaining a 
	small team. Now, Pinterest is one major traffic avenue for blogs and is 
	responsible for e-commere revenues of most online businesses.
	Xerox. Xerox is synonymous to photopcopying. In 2012, it started its move and
	is now offering cloud services as well.
	Instagram. When it started, Instagram was hosted on one single computer. After
	its successful launch, that single computer wasn’t going to ge the job done. 
	No way could it handle the traffic, thus the move to cloud. Instagram was bought 
	by Facebook at $1 billion last 2012.
	Etsy. An e-commerce site, Etsy turned to cloud computing after finding itself 
	bombarded by data for sorting.
	Apple. We can’t deny the fact that Apple lives up to its name no matter what 
	mishaps occur or what critiques are thrown at this giant. So nobody was surprised 
	when it turn to the cloud after lunching Siri. Now Apple’s innovating more 
	products and we know will see more cloud-related services in the near future.</p>


<h1> Although i love cloud service there is a minor downside to it like the following</h1>

  <p>Broad network access</p>

  <p>Resource pooling</p>
 
  <p>Rapid elasticity</p>
 
  <p>Measured service</p>
